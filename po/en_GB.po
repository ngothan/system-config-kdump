"Kdump is a new kernel crash dumping mechanism. In the event of a system "
"crash, a core file can be captured using kdump, which runs in the context of "
"a freshly booted kernel, making it far more reliable than methods capturing "
"within the context of the crashed kernel. Being able to capture a core file "
"can be invaluable in helping determine the root cause of a system crash. "
"Note that kdump does require reserving a portion of system memory that will "
"be unavailable for other uses."
